# FF16 Converter
A simple CLI tool to convert multiple FF16 formats. Currently supports
- .tex (texture file)
- .pkg (subtitles)

Plan to support font files (.fnt) from .ttf in another update along with multiple images from .tex.

## Usage
- Drag/drop .tex or .pkg to create .png/.dds or .xml.
- Drag/drop the file back to replace .tex or .pkg.
- Drag/drop to ConvertDDS.bat or use -dds in command line to create .dds instead of png.

Texture support only supports replacing and only with one texture in .tex atm. Creating from scatch will be added in soon.
